    This beautiful manipulation task with Bennett mechanism was made 
    by Tomas Postula, VSB - Technical University of Ostrava, Czechia. 
    I helped him only a little with very first design of the linkage. 
    After Tomas finished I had to make and assemble one also for myself asap. 
    Based on experience from public outreach events, kids totally love it! ❤️

  gif: "rl.gif" 
  description: |
    Although not a mechanism, I created this interactive toolbox
    for synthesis and rapid prototyping of rational linkages during
    my postdoc at the University of Innsbruck, Austria. It is open-source 
    ([code on GitHub](https://github.com/hucik14/rational-linkages)),
    and you can easily get it via `pip install rational-linkages`,
    as it is [available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/rational-linkages/).

  gif: "r6.gif" 
  description: |
    Rational 6R mechanism with 1 DoF, whose coupler motion
    is parameterized by a cubic rational function. 
    Collision-free line model was proposed by Zijia Li from the
    Chinese Academy of Sciences, China. Solid curved-link model 
    was made using Rational Linkages.

- title: "Shaky 3-RPR"
  gif: "m3rpr.gif"
  description: |
    The structure should be rigid (imagine pneumatic actuators in the legs 
    that that keep length in this configuration), however it is shaky 
    (infinitesimally moveable) because the direct kinematics solutions coincide.
    It was proposed by Manfred Husty, University of Innsbruck, Austria.

- title: "Even shakier 3-RPR"
  gif: "g3rpr.gif"
  description: |
    The flexibility of this 3-RPR was "enhanced" by replacing rigid bodies 
    (base and coupler triangular platforms) and assembling 
    them using bars in the mechanism's co-linear configuration.
    The moveability is limited by self-collisions, 
    so in reality it would be even higher portion of infinitesimal motion.
    It was proposed by Georg Nawratil from TU Wien, Austria.

  description: |
    This 9R is supposed to have 3 DoFs, but has only 1 as the axes form a discrete Möbius strip.
    It was proposed by Manfred Husty, University of Innsbruck, Austria.
