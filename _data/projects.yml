  description: >
    The structure shall be rigid (imagine pneumatic actuators in the legs 
    that that keep length in this configuration), however it is shaky 
    (infinitesimally moveable) because the direct kinematics solutions coincide.
    It was proposed by Manfred Husty, University of Innsbruck, Austria.

  description: >
    This 3-RPR structure's flexibility is limited by self-collisions, 
    so in reality it would be even higher portion of infinitesimal motion.
    It was proposed by Georg Nawratil from TU Wien, Austria.

- title: "Möbius linkage (9R with 1 DoF)"
  gif: "r9.gif"
  description: >
    This 9R is supposed to have 3 DoFs, but has only 1 as the axes form a discrete Möbius strip.
    It was proposed by Manfred Husty, University of Innsbruck, Austria.
