  description: |
    My state-of-the-art design of the Bennett linkage fidget-like toy,
    used for public outreach events to demonstrate
    the beauty of spatial mechanisms. Kids do the assembly 
    and can take their own Bennett mechanism home. 
    They totally love it and many fathers seem jealous 😄

  description: |
    A snapping (bi-stable) four-bar has two rigid configurations. 
    The beutiful geometrical construction that relates to the two
    limit poses of Henrici's flexible hyperboloid was done by 
    Hellmuth Stachel, TU Wien, Austria, in our joint work.

  description: |
    This beautiful manipulation task with Bennett mechanism was made 
    by Tomas Postula, VSB - Technical University of Ostrava, Czechia. 
    I helped him only a little with very first design of the linkage. 
    After Tomas finished I had to make and assemble one also for myself asap. 
    Based on experience from public outreach events, some kids come repeatedly
    and stare at it amazed for a few minutes ❤️

    <img src="assets/rl-logo.png" style="height:30px;width:auto;vertical-align:-0.15em" alt="RL logo">
    Although not a mechanism but Python package, I created this interactive 
    toolbox for synthesis and rapid prototyping of rational linkages
    during my postdoc at the University of Innsbruck, Austria. It is open-source 
    ([code on GitHub](https://github.com/hucik14/rational-linkages)),
    and you can easily get it via «`pip install rational-linkages`»
    as it is [available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/rational-linkages/).

- title: "Motorized 6R"
  gif: "r6.gif" 
  description: |
    Rational 6R mechanism with 1 DoF, whose coupler motion
    is parameterized by a cubic rational function. 
    Collision-free line model was proposed by Zijia Li from the
    Chinese Academy of Sciences, China. Solid curved-link model 
    was made using Rational Linkages.

- title: "Shaky 3-RPR"
  gif: "m3rpr.gif"
  description: |
    The structure should be rigid (imagine pneumatic actuators in the legs 
    that that keep length in this configuration), however it is shaky 
    (infinitesimally moveable) because the direct kinematics solutions coincide.
    It was proposed by Manfred Husty, University of Innsbruck, Austria.

  doi: "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-45705-0_58"



- title: "Even shakier 3-RPR"
  gif: "g3rpr.gif"
  description: |
    The flexibility of this 3-RPR was "enhanced" by replacing rigid bodies 
    (base and coupler triangular platforms) and assembling 
    them using bars in the mechanism's co-linear configuration.
    The moveability is limited by self-collisions, 
    so in reality it would be even higher portion of infinitesimal motion.
    It was proposed by Georg Nawratil from TU Wien, Austria.

- title: "Multimode 7R with no 7R mode"
  gif: "multimode-xk.gif"
  description: |
    This multimode 7R never reaches its expected motion mode
    with 1 DoF and 7 revolute joints.
    Instead, it switches between multiple 
    different motion modes with various degrees of freedom.
    It was proposed by Xianwen Kong from Heriot-Watt University, UK.

- title: "Möbius linkage"
  gif: "r9.gif"
  description: |
    This 9R is supposed to have 3 DoFs, but has only 1 as the axes form a discrete Möbius strip.
    It was proposed by Manfred Husty, University of Innsbruck, Austria.

- title: "Serial 3R"
  gif: "serial3r.gif" 
  description: |
    This demo was created as part of my PhD,
    to show the capabilies of the methodology. 
    The topic was focused on synthesis of serial manipulators
    in environment with collisions.
