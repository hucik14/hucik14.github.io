  description: >
    The structure shall be rigid (imagine pneumatic actuators in the legs 
    that that keep length in this configuration), however it is shaky 
    (infinitesimally moveable) because the direct kinematics solutions coincide.
    It was proposed by Manfred Husty.

  description: >
    This 9R is supposed to have 3 DoFs, but has only 1 as the axes form a discrete Möbius strip.
    It was proposed by Manfred Husty.
